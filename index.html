<h1>Founding of the Arizona Air National Guard</h1>

        <p>
            Beginning with the American Revolution's "Minutemen" at Lexington and Concord, the citizen-soldier,
            the National Guard, has long been a critical resource of the American military.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the advent of aviation early in the 20th century, individuals quickly began to see the 
            application of the airplane as miltary weapon. Many of these early pioneers were National Guardsman.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 1912, only three years after its organization, the First Signal Company, New York National Guard, got their first airplane off the ground. Units in California and Missouri were soon to follow. Renamed the First Aero Company, New York National Guard, the squadron was mobilized in 1915 to combat the border raids of Pancho Villa.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was World War Two, though, that saw the full potential of the airplane's military use recognized. In 1941, 4800 men from 29 National Guard units helped begin what was to become the U.S. Army Air Force. Following the war, a number of WWII Army Air Force squadrons were reorganized into Air Guard units and established in several states around the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 412th Fighter Squadron, a unit that had earned extensive combat flying honors in Europe was redesignated the 197th Fighter Squadron, and on December 12, 1946, became the first unit of the Arizona Air National Guard, with an authorized strength of 300 enlisted and 50 officers.
